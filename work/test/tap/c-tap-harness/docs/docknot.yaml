blurb: |
  C TAP Harness is a pure-C implementation of TAP, the Test Anything Protocol.
  TAP is the text-based protocol used by Perl's test suite.  This package
  provides a harness similar to Perl's Test::Harness for running tests, with
  some additional features useful for test suites in packages that use
  Autoconf and Automake, and C and shell libraries to make writing
  TAP-compliant test programs easier.

description: |
  This package started as the runtests program I wrote for INN in 2000 to
  serve as the basis for a new test suite using a test protocol similar to
  that used for Perl modules.  When I started maintaining additional C
  packages, I adopted runtests for the test suite driver of those as well,
  resulting in further improvements but also separate copies of the same
  program in different distributions.  The C TAP Harness distribution merges
  all the various versions into a single code base that all my packages can
  pull from.

  C TAP Harness provides a full TAP specification driver (apart from a few
  possible edge cases) and has additional special features for supporting
  builds outside the source directory.  It's mostly useful for packages using
  Autoconf and Automake and because it doesn't assume or require Perl.

  The runtests program can be built with knowledge of the source and build
  directory and pass that knowledge on to test scripts, and will search for
  test scripts in both the source and build directory.  This makes it easier
  for packages using Autoconf and Automake and supporting out-of-tree builds
  to build some test programs, ship others, and run them all regardless of
  what tree they're in.  It also makes it easier for test cases to find their
  supporting files when they run.

  Also included in this package are C and shell libraries that provide utility
  functions for writing test scripts that use TAP to report results.  The C
  library also provides a variety of utility functions useful for test
  programs running as part of an Automake-built package: finding test data
  files, creating temporary files, reporting output from external programs
  running in the background, and similar common problems.

requirements: |
  C TAP Harness requires a C compiler to build.  Any ISO C89 or later C
  compiler on a system supporting the Single UNIX Specification, version 3
  (SUSv3) should be sufficient.  This should not be a problem on any modern
  system.  The test suite and shell library require a Bourne-compatible shell.
  Outside of the test suite, C TAP Harness has no other prerequisites or
  requirements.

  C TAP Harness can also be built with a C++ compiler and should be similarly
  portable to any recent C++ compiler, although it is only tested with g++.

  lancaster: true
  override: |
    C TAP Harness comes with a comprehensive test suite, which you can run
    after building with:

    ```
        make check
    ```

    If a test fails, you can run a single test with verbose output via:

    ```
        tests/runtests -b $(pwd)/tests -s $(pwd)/tests -o <name-of-test>
    ```

    Do this instead of running the test program directly since it will ensure
    that necessary environment variables are set up.  You may need to change
    the `-s` option argument if you build with a separate build directory from
    the source directory.

    To run the test suite, you will need Perl 5.10 or later.  The following
    additional Perl modules will be used by the test suite if present:

    * Test::Pod
    * Test::Spelling

    All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules are
    not available.

  - title: Using the Harness
    body: |
      While there is an install target that installs runtests in the default
      binary directory (`/usr/local/bin` by default) and installs the man
      pages, one normally wouldn't install anything from this package.
      Instead, the code is intended to be copied into your package and
      refreshed from the latest release of C TAP Harness for each release.

      You can obviously copy the code and integrate it however works best for
      your package and your build system.  Here's how I do it for my packages
      as an example:

      * Create a tests directory and copy tests/runtests.c into it.  Create a
        `tests/tap` subdirectory and copy the portions of the TAP library
        (from `tests/tap`) that I need for that package into it.  The TAP
        library is designed to let you drop in additional source and header
        files for additional utility functions that are useful in your
        package.

      * Add code to my top-level `Makefile.am` (I always use a non-recursive
        Makefile with `subdir-objects` set) to build `runtests` and the test
        library:

        ```make
            check_PROGRAMS = tests/runtests
            tests_runtests_CPPFLAGS = \
                    -DC_TAP_SOURCE='"$(abs_top_srcdir)/tests"' \
                    -DC_TAP_BUILD='"$(abs_top_builddir)/tests"'
            check_LIBRARIES = tests/tap/libtap.a
            tests_tap_libtap_a_CPPFLAGS = -I$(abs_top_srcdir)/tests
            tests_tap_libtap_a_SOURCES = tests/tap/basic.c tests/tap/basic.h \
                    tests/tap/float.c tests/tap/float.h tests/tap/macros.h
        ```

        Omit `float.c` and `float.h` from the last line if your package
        doesn't need the `is_double` function.  Building the build and source
        directories into runtests will let `tests/runtests -o <test>` work for
        users without requiring that they set any other variables, even if
        they're doing an out-of-source build.

        Add additional source files and headers that should go into the TAP
        library if you added extra utility functions for your package.

      * Add code to `Makefile.am` to run the test suite:

        ```make
            check-local: $(check_PROGRAMS)
                  cd tests && ./runtests -l $(abs_top_srcdir)/tests/TESTS
        ```

        See the `Makefile.am` in this package for an example.

      * List the test programs in the `tests/TESTS` file.  This should have
        the name of the test executable with the trailing "-t" or ".t" (you
        can use either extension as you prefer) omitted.

        Test programs must be executable.

        For any test programs that need to be compiled, add build rules for
        them in `Makefile.am`, similar to:

        ```make
            tests_libtap_c_basic_LDADD = tests/tap/libtap.a
        ```

        and add them to `check_PROGRAMS`.  If you include the `float.c` add-on
        in your libtap library, you will need to add `-lm` to the `_LDADD`
        setting for all test programs linked against it.

        A more complex example from the remctl package that needs additional
        libraries:

        ```make
            tests_client_open_t_LDFLAGS = $(GSSAPI_LDFLAGS)
            tests_client_open_t_LDADD = client/libremctl.la tests/tap/libtap.a \
                    util/libutil.la $(GSSAPI_LIBS)
        ```

        If the test program doesn't need to be compiled, add it to `EXTRA_DIST`
        so that it will be included in the distribution.

      * If you have test programs written in shell, copy `tests/tap/libtap.sh`
        the tap subdirectory of your tests directory and add it to
        `EXTRA_DIST`.  Shell programs should start with:

        ```sh
            . "${C_TAP_SOURCE}/tap/libtap.sh"
        ```

        and can then use the functions defined in the library.

      * Optionally copy `docs/writing-tests` into your package somewhere, such
        as `tests/README`, as instructions to contributors on how to write
        tests for this framework.

      If you have configuration files that the user must create to enable some
      of the tests, conventionally they go into `tests/config`.

      If you have data files that your test cases use, conventionally they go
      into `tests/data`.  You can then find the data directory relative to the
      `C_TAP_SOURCE` environment variable (set by `runtests`) in your test
      program.  If you have data that's compiled or generated by Autoconf, it
      will be relative to the `BUILD` environment variable.  Don't forget to
      add test data to `EXTRA_DIST` as necessary.

      For more TAP library add-ons, generally ones that rely on additional
      portability code not shipped in this package or with narrower uses, see
      [the rra-c-util
      package](https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/rra-c-util/).  There are
      several additional TAP library add-ons in the `tests/tap` directory in
      that package.  It's also an example of how to use this test harness in
      another package.
